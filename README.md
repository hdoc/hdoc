    hdoc: the modern documentation tool for C++
</h3>

## An important notice about this repository

The contents of this repository are a subset of a private repository where hdoc's development takes place.

## Overview and features

* **Autogenerated API documentation.** hdoc generated API documentation for every function, record, enum, and namespace in your codebase.
* **Integrated Markdown pages.** hdoc converts your Markdown pages into a website and puts it next to your API docs. All of your documentation is in one place.
* **Instant codebase search.** Instant search-as-you-type lookup of symbols throughout your entire codebase.
* **Easy CI integration.** Your documentation is never out of date if you build it with your code. All you need to do is add hdoc to your build job.
* **Advanced C++ parser.** hdoc understands the newest C++ features with its advanced LLVM/Clang-based parser.
* **Clean, fast output.** hdoc outputs fully static HTML with no required Javascript, ensuring your users never have to wait.

## Quick start

### Linux

hdoc depends on LLVM/Clang and OpenSSL, and all other dependencies are vendored in `subprojects/`.
hdoc also comes with a Nix Flake which sets up a development environment for you with all of the needed dependencies, and should work on all Linux distributions.
Follow the instructions below to build hdoc.

```sh
# Build hdoc
meson build             # Configure the build directory
ninja -C build          # Compile hdoc binaries and tests
./build/hdoc --verbose  # Run hdoc over itself, saving the HTML documentation to ./hdoc-output/
```

### Windows

Thanks for project MinGW, Cygwin and MSYS2, we are able to compile hdoc into native applications on Windows platform without any code changed.

In order to compile windows-native hdoc, an environment of `MSYS2` and `MinGW-w64-x86_64-gcc` is needed to be prepared. Then, follow the instructions below to build.

```sh
# Install dependent packages for MinGW
pacman -S groff
pacman -S unzip
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-meson
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang-analyzer
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang-tools-extra
# Set PATH
export PATH=/mingw64/bin:/mingw64/lib:$PATH		# You can also add this line into ~/.bashrc
# Build hdoc
meson build             # Configure the build directory
ninja -C build          # Compile hdoc binaries and tests
./build/hdoc --verbose  # Run hdoc over itself, saving the HTML documentation to ./hdoc-output/
```

It takes a long time (maybe hours) to build hdoc.exe, but it will finally finish and works well on Windows platform.  

More instructions for using hdoc can be found at [hdoc.io/docs](https://hdoc.io/docs).

## Running tests

hdoc has a suite of unit and integration tests, which can be run using the instructions below.

```sh
# Assumes you've already built hdoc
cd build

# Running indexing tests and unit tests
./index-tests
./unit-tests

# Running integration tests
cd ../tests/integration_tests
./clone_test_repos.sh          # Pull testing repos from GitHub
./test.sh                      # Run hdoc over testing repos
```
